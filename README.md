# NLP Assignments

This repository contains PDF files of various NLP assignments I completed during my college semester.



## Description

These assignments cover various topics and techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP), including text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and more. The original Jupyter notebooks were unfortunately lost, but the PDFs provide a detailed view of the work completed.

## Future Work

I plan to recreate the Jupyter notebooks from these PDFs to enable executable code and further experimentation.
